Our first action was to create an overview of existing skillsets within our groups and find which skills we will have to develop during the two semesters and the interposed practice phase.

### Available skills  

### Jonas  
  no experience with Android or PHP  
  NVC learned during a past practice phase  
  Java skills from the first two semesters  
  C# relatively well established. Used regularly during the practice phases  
  HTML, Java Script for Websites (able to build webpages - including layouts)  
	
### Marina

  No experinece in creating databases, but able to connect existing databases with the Front End and display the contents (using C#)  
  C# and React experience during practice phases  

### Nils

  Nodejs first exposure during the last practice phase  
  Project Management skills from several leadership positions in different contexts  

### We will still need to develop:
 - ability to build a database
 - work with Kotlin (which is based upon Java) to use with Android App
 - create an understanding of all necessary steps to complete a Software Engineering project.

### Necessary Tools:
 - Wordpress Webseite
 - Projektmanagement Tool – most likely Azure Dev Ops - since Marina and Jonas work with it in their work environment
 - GitHub – Project
 - Prof Webseite: https://kay.fasten-your-seat-belts.de/  (Mostly for communication with other groups)

### General idea for the app:
 - 5 minute workouts – people doing excercises and sharing their own  
 - Motivational excercises  
 - Ability to Track your own progress  
 - Share results and workouts with friends  
 - Ability for people to share their progress and excercises maybe even participate in challenges (not part of MVP)  
  
### Basic functions:
 - Login (Name, Age, #workouts per week, weight, height, gender, resting heart rate, chest, abs, waist, legs) 
 - Workout interests (different categories), goals, motives  
 - workouts and exercises including descriptions and optional videos
