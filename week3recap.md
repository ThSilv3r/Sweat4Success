# Recap week 2

• Post was created by Marina. Prof Berk wants us to comment back on comments we get for our blog posts

• Reviews by Jonas and Nils completed. We are now making screenshots of the reviews to ensure that they are visible since some groups don't make them visible in time

• We started to look into different options we have to create our project. We wanted to use Kotlin or Java, because it gave everyone the best chance to contribute to the code.

• Most likely we will be using Android Studio for our project. It gives us great tools and was designed for cellphone apps.

• Some issues remain with azure dev ops, so we are not using it as we want, but hopefully get it fixed by next week.


## Week 3 session: SRS and Use Cases

• First version of the SRS is ready and can be found and updated here:

• The first two Use Cases have been created and the UC Diagram is ready. 

• Our plan is to have the User Login, the create account and the edit account functionality up and running by the end of the semester
