## Recap week 3
-	Blog posts and reviews were done, however prof berk still needs to sign up on them

-	Marina is now set up and we can start using Azure Dev ops as planned

- We didn't really have time to get familiar with Android Studio, so this needs to be a point of emphasis this week!!!

## Week 4 session:

- We created the first 2 Use cases, however they are not complete yet and need additional work.
- We will need to do 3 more over the course of the first semester, so each person will contribute 1
