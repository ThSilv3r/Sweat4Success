Our goal is to create an Android app that allows users to track their fitness results while also sharing progress and workouts with other users
to create a community feeling that helps people to continue striving for their fitness goals.

Furthermore, the app will support the user by finding suitable workouts comparable to the users favorite and past workouts to keep them motivated.

The idea is to have short 5-10 minute workouts that people can easily do at home or whereever they are. 
Another reason for the short workouts is that people can more easily motivate themselves to do shorter workouts which helps keep their streaks going.

In a perfect world this app helps to improve overall health and fitness in our communities.
